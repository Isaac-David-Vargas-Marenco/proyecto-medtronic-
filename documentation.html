    <h2 style="margin-top: 10%">3. Before you start:</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 2%">The following web page uses HTML, CSS3, CSS and Javascript (DOM) Previous knowledge in this technology is important and you can check it <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=HTML+%2C+CSS+y+javascript&title=Especial%3ABuscar&go=Ir&ns0=1&ns100=1&ns104=1" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 10%">4. Aspects of the website:</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 2%"> This website was designed for Medtronic. The information that appears here is verified by us for you, the users of the page and visitors. the page has several programming languages ​​in its code and these are HTML, CSS and Javascript with Swal Js, Of those four languages ​​written here I am going to tell you and explain what they are for, what they are for and how they work this information will be further down in page.<a href="" target="_blank"></a></p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 10%">A. HTML:</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 2%">The project contains 2 HTML templates called documentation.html in this is written the documentation of this beautiful project created by us for you and Index.html is what you can see on the main page things like the form, the images and the footer which is at the end. The entrypoint of this project is the Index.html.The index.html is our entrypoint here a brief explanation of what an entry point is and in programming languages ​​the entry point is the procedure to start a program, in many programming languages, the start of a program is set by the main procedure.
    More information about html <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">here.</a></p> 

    <h2 style="margin-top: 10%">B. CSS:</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 2%">CSS, in English "Cascading Style Sheets", is a graphic design language for defining and creating the presentation of a structured document written in a markup language. The CSS template used in this project was already by default, so we only changed the flexbox and the encoded content. so that the images look like you see them on our main page and I'm going to leave you a link with more information about CSS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 10%">C. JS (JavaScript):</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 2%">JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is best known as a scripting language for web pages, and is used in many non-browser environments, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat, JavaScript is a prototype-based programming language, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic, with support for object-oriented, imperative and declarative programming (eg functional programming). and we use it so that an alert appears as soon as you submit the form and the Javascript language was the most complicated for us to program. I'm going to leave you more information about Javascript <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 10%">C.1 Swal JS:</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 2%">Swal is a Javascript library for the elaboration of more beautiful, accommodating alerts and they are almost done, you just have to put your JS in them so that the alert appears as you want. I'm going to put the Swal page for you to create your own alerts <a href="https://sweetalert2.github.io/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
    

    <h2 style="margin-top: 10%">C.2  Basic JS Components :</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 2%">The components that the alert that I made for the form has several Javascript components that I am going to write to you, the JS components are: var, document, getElementById,  Onclick, event.preventDefault, function, the ids of the form, .value, Swal.fire and here you put the previous components written more information for the elaboration of an alert touch <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_form_submit.asp" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:10%">C.3 JSON</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 2%">JSON is a simple text format for data exchange. This is a subset of JavaScript's object literal notation, but because of its wide adoption as an alternative to XML, it's considered a language-independent format, and we put JSON in the form so you can see the data you entered into our form. page and if you want more JSON information touch <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank" >here.</a></p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:10%">C.4 JQuery</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 2%">Our page implemented the jquery in the swal alert previously written in this documentation and I am going to leave you a brief description of it
      jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library, initially created by John Resig, that allows you to simplify the way you interact with HTML documents, manipulate the DOM tree, handle events, develop animations, and add AJAX interaction to web pages. jquery link for you to try <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank" >here.</a></p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 10%">D. Google Analytics :</h2>
      <p style="margin-top: 2%">Google Analytics is a web analytics tool from the Google company launched on November 14, 2005. It offers grouped information on the traffic that reaches websites according to the audience, the acquisition, the behavior and the conversions that take place in the website. website, every week I am going to change the word link of the google analytics in the future it will have its own HTML but still ;)
