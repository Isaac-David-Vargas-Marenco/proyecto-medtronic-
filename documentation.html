    <p style="margin-top: 2%">JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is best known as a scripting language for web pages, and is used in many non-browser environments, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat, JavaScript is a prototype-based programming language, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic, with support for object-oriented, imperative and declarative programming (eg functional programming). and we use it so that an alert appears as soon as you submit the form and the Javascript language was the most complicated for us to program. I'm going to leave you more information about Javascript <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
